# CORE-TX
The project aims at designing and implementing the perception module of a robotic component of the CORE-TX robotic platform.
The main goal of the project is to design the perception module both hardware and software.
The perception module is an embedded system with an ARM microcontroller that manages robot sensors such as: temperature, humidity, LIDAR, SONAR.
